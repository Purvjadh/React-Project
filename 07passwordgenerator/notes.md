### useRef
-----------------------------------------------------------------

## useRef is actually used to store the reference of html element 

## useRef is simply a object where we has access of .current

## useState is responsible for re-rendering of that particular DOM element but useRef does not rerenders that element no matters how many changes you are doing in that particular element
